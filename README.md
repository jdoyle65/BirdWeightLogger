BirdWeightLogger
================

Project for automated, hands free weighing of birds.

This project uses the following hardware:

1. Phidget 1024_0 RFID Reader-Writer
2. Phidget 1046_0 Bridge 4-Input
3. Phidget 3132_0 Micro Load Cell (0g - 780g)
4. Raspberry Pi - Model B (Running on Raspbian 7.1)
5. 4 port powered USB hub (Needed to output sufficient power to Phidgets. The Pi does not provide enough power through its USB ports)
